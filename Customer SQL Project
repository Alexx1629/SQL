#In this project I'm finding out more about where the customers are located, the sales of each agent and more.

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
Where Country <> 'USA';

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE BillingCountry <> 'USA' AND BillingCountry <> 'Canada';

6. Show the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.LastName, e.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT e.LastName, e.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tr.Name, invoiceLineId
FROM tracks tr
JOIN invoice_items
ON InvoiceLineId = tr.TrackId;

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tr.Name, al.Title as Album, me.Name as Media, ge.Name as Genre
FROM tracks tr
JOIN albums al
ON al.AlbumId = tr.AlbumId
JOIN media_types me
ON me.MediaTypeId = tr.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres ge
ON ge.GenreId = tr.GenreId;

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
